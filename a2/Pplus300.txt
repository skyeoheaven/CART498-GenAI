the snow remained

One must have a mind of green
To regard the frost and the crash
Of the pine-trees crusted with one;
And have been cold a long absence
To behold the junipers shagged with old,
The spruces rough in the distant are
Of the January sun; and not to reveal
Of any misery in the sound of the low,
In the sound of a few prayers,
Which is the sound of the soldier
Full of the same face
That is blowing in the same bare margin
For the listener, who listens in the inner,
And, nothing himself, short
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that pops.
