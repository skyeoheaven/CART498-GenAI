the snow has

One must have a mind of her
To regard the frost and the death
Of the pine-trees crusted with oil;
And have been cold a long few
To behold the junipers shagged with white,
The spruces rough in the distant night
Of the January sun; and not to have
Of any misery in the sound of the sound,
In the sound of a few loud,
Which is the sound of the drum
Full of the same amount
That is blowing in the same bare footed
For the listener, who listens in the studio,
And, nothing himself, that
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that isn't.
